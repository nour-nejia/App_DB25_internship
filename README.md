## Overview

The **DB25** project was developed during my internship at **Ampere Software Technology**.  
It aims to simplify the management and analysis of **Electronic Control Unit (ECU)** configuration files used in vehicles.  
These files, in **BLOB** or **XML** format, contain essential information for vehicle diagnostics and configuration.
